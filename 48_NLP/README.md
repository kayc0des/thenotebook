# Roadmap Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. It’s about teaching machines to handle language as we do—whether it's reading, writing, or even speaking.

NLP powers things like:

- Voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa) to understand and respond to speech.
- Chatbots that can have conversations with you.
- Translation tools like Google Translate.
- Text analysis for summarizing or extracting information from documents.

## Step 1
Cleaning the input text - Text preprocessing 1
    
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization
- Stemming
- Stop words

## Step 2
Converting input text to Vectors

- Text Preprocessing 2 (BOW, TF-IDF, Bigrams etc)

## Step 3
Advance Text Preprocessing

- word2vec
- Avgword2vec

## Step 4
Deep Learning Models that handle sequential data

- RNN
- LSTM
- GRU RNN

## Step 5
Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are a way to represent words as numbers (or vectors) so that a machine can understand them. In this representation, words that have similar meanings or are used in similar contexts are placed closer together in a multi-dimensional space. It's like mapping words into coordinates, where similar words have similar "addresses."

## Step 6
Advance Models

- Transformers
