[Code Tutorial: Stemming](https://github.com/kayc0des/thenotebook/blob/main/48_NLP/tutorial/02_stemming.ipynb)

Stemming is a process in natural language processing (NLP) that reduces words to their base or root form. It involves stripping away prefixes and suffixes from words to get to the core meaning. For example:

- The words "running," "ran," and "runner" are all reduced to the root word "run."
- Similarly, "better" may be reduced to "better" or "good," depending on the stemming algorithm used.

The main goal of stemming is to treat different forms of a word as the same for analysis, making it easier to group and analyze text data. It helps improve the efficiency of searching and processing large amounts of text by reducing the variations of words.

## Disadvantages of Stemming 

- Loss of Meaning: Stemming often reduces words to their root forms, which can lead to a loss of nuance and meaning. For example, the stem "run" could represent "running," "runner," and "ran," making it harder to understand the specific context.

- Over-stemming and Under-stemming: Sometimes, stemming can be too aggressive, leading to over-stemming where distinct words are reduced to the same root (e.g., "organ" and "organization" both reduced to "organ"). Conversely, under-stemming occurs when related words aren't reduced to the same root, missing opportunities for better grouping.

- Inconsistent Results: Different stemming algorithms may produce different results for the same word, leading to inconsistency in text processing and analysis.

- Language-Specific Challenges: Stemming algorithms are often designed for specific languages, and their effectiveness can vary significantly across languages, especially those with rich morphology.

- Not Suitable for All Applications: In tasks that require precise meaning or understanding, such as sentiment analysis or information retrieval, stemming might hinder performance because it oversimplifies the language.

- Increased Complexity: Implementing stemming can add complexity to the preprocessing pipeline, requiring additional resources for handling and managing stemming algorithms effectively.
