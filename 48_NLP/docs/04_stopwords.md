# Text Preprocessing: Stopwords

In natural language processing (NLP), stopwords are common words that carry little meaning on their own and are usually filtered out during text preprocessing. These words appear frequently in the language and don't contribute much to understanding the content or semantics of a sentence.

Examples of stopwords in English include:

- Articles: "a", "an", "the"
- Pronouns: "he", "she", "it"
- Prepositions: "in", "on", "at"
- Conjunctions: "and", "but", "or"

By removing stopwords, NLP models can focus on more meaningful words that contribute to understanding the main idea or context of a text. For instance, in the sentence:

`"The cat is on the mat",`

after removing stopwords, it might become:

`"cat mat".`

This filtering helps reduce the size of the data and improves the efficiency of algorithms like text classification, sentiment analysis, or search engines.
