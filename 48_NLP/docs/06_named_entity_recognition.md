# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. NER helps extract meaningful information from raw text by tagging specific entities and grouping them into useful classes.

For example, in the sentence:

"Barack Obama was born in Honolulu on August 4, 1961."

NER would identify and classify:

- Kingsley Budu as a PERSON
- Cameroon as a LOCATION
- August 4, 1961 as a DATE

## Common Named Entity Types:

- PERSON: Names of people (e.g., Kingsley budu, Marie Curie)
- ORGANIZATION: Names of organizations (e.g., Google, United Nations)
- LOCATION: Names of geographical locations (e.g., New York, Paris)
- DATE: Specific dates or time periods (e.g., August 4, 1961, yesterday)
- TIME: Times of day (e.g., 3 PM, noon)
- MONEY: Monetary amounts (e.g., $20, 50 euros)
- PERCENT: Percentages (e.g., 20%, 50%)
- FACILITY: Buildings or landmarks (e.g., Eiffel Tower, Sydney Opera House)
- GPE (Geo-political entity): Countries, cities, states (e.g., Canada, California)

NER is widely used in applications like information retrieval, question answering, and automatic summarization because it helps break down complex text into key elements related to people, places, and important dates.
